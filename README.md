(THIS CODE WAS MADE ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES)
Essentialy a very basic version of Minecraft that runs entirely in a Command Prompt.
I made back in October 2023 because I was bored in my C# course and wanted more of a challenge.

Currently has a few bugs, but players can place blocks, dig, move around the world, and change camera angles.
Only a few blocks are implemented but water and lava both are present, move as they should, and make stone when they touch.

Not too sure if I'll ever update this since the console is so limited, but never say never.
